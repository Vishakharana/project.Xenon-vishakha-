# Complete responsive website of a Restaurant
I made a complete responsive website on a restaurant on which the user can order food online. In this project there is a login page and register page and also a contact us page. 
## importance of website for a restaurant
Nowadays it is now very unusual for a business not to have some sort of presence online. With improved connectivity and the advances in smartphone technologies most people now use the internet to source information, and having your business available to fulfil these information searches is key to driving more footfall through your door.

A website gives you a controlled way to portray an image of your business as you would like it, giving your customers an idea of the atmosphere and offering before even stepping a foot inside.
